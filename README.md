# P2PSkins

This project is a very simple prototype based on an idea I had: a peer-to-peer skin trading platform without bots or taxes involved. Itâ€™s a basic concept, but it shows how such a platform could look and function on the frontend.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (LTS version 22 or higher)
- **Angular** (version 18 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project from this repository:  
   [https://github.com/OscarGE11/P2PSkins](https://github.com/OscarGE11/P2PSkins)

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.
